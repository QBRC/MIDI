# MIDI
This is the official codebase for **MIDI: Attention-Guided Mechanism-Interpretable Drug-Gene Interaction (MIDI) Modeling for Cancer Drug Response Prediction and Target Effect Explanation**.

Note this codebase and our web server are currently used only for reviewing purpose for the journal submission.

## Introduction
MIDI is an AI model trained on CCLE dataset to analyse the targeting relationship between drug molecules against genetic patterns. It can be used to predict cancer drug response, provide explaination of the molecular binding cite and detect the drug targeted genes.

MIDI is now available for a brief demo in our webserver: https://ai.swmed.edu/projects/midi/ 

## Installation

MIDI works with Python >= 3.11.9 Please make sure you have the correct version of Python, and with anaconda installed

```bash
conda create -n "envtest" python=3.11.9
conda activate envtest
bash requirement.txt
```

## Training data statistics and model explaination demonstration
The current model training is performed on CCLE dataset, for specific drug-gene interaction dataset, please refer to the paper manuscript.

## Pretrained scGPT Model Zoo

Here is the list of pretrained models. Please find the links for downloading the checkpoint folders. We recommend using the `whole-human` model for most applications by default. If your fine-tuning dataset shares similar cell type context with the training data of the organ-specific models, these models can usually demonstrate competitive performance as well. A paired vocabulary file mapping gene names to ids is provided in each checkpoint folder. If ENSEMBL ids are needed, please find the conversion at [gene_info.csv](https://github.com/bowang-lab/scGPT/files/13243634/gene_info.csv).

## Fine-tune scGPT for scRNA-seq integration

Please see our example code in [examples/finetune_integration.py](examples/finetune_integration.py). By default, the script assumes the scGPT checkpoint folder stored in the `examples/save` directory.
