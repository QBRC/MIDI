# MIDI
This is the official codebase for **MIDI: Attention-Guided Mechanism-Interpretable Drug-Gene Interaction (MIDI) Modeling for Cancer Drug Response Prediction and Target Effect Explanation**.

![Webapp](https://ai.swmed.edu/projects/midi/) &nbsp;

### Introduction
MIDI is an AI model that analyse the targeting relationship between drug molecules against genetic patterns. It can be used to
predict cancer drug response, molecular binding cite and find noval gene targets.

MIDI is now available for a breif demo in our webserver: https://ai.swmed.edu/projects/midi/

## Installation

MIDI works with Python = 3.7.13 and R >=3.6.1. Please make sure you have the correct version of Python 

```bash
pip install scgpt "flash-attn<1.0.5"  # optional, recommended
# As of 2023.09, pip install may not run with new versions of the google orbax package, if you encounter related issues, please use the following command instead:
# pip install scgpt "flash-attn<1.0.5" "orbax<0.1.8"
```

[Optional] We recommend using [wandb](https://wandb.ai/) for logging and visualization.

```bash
pip install wandb
```

For developing, we are using the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager. To install Poetry, follow the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

```bash
$ git clone this-repo-url
$ cd scGPT
$ poetry install
```

**Note**: The `flash-attn` dependency usually requires specific GPU and CUDA version. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [flash-attn](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention/tree/main) repository for installation instructions. For now, May 2023, we recommend using CUDA 11.7 and flash-attn<1.0.5 due to various issues reported about installing new versions of flash-attn.

## Pretrained scGPT Model Zoo

Here is the list of pretrained models. Please find the links for downloading the checkpoint folders. We recommend using the `whole-human` model for most applications by default. If your fine-tuning dataset shares similar cell type context with the training data of the organ-specific models, these models can usually demonstrate competitive performance as well. A paired vocabulary file mapping gene names to ids is provided in each checkpoint folder. If ENSEMBL ids are needed, please find the conversion at [gene_info.csv](https://github.com/bowang-lab/scGPT/files/13243634/gene_info.csv).

## Fine-tune scGPT for scRNA-seq integration

Please see our example code in [examples/finetune_integration.py](examples/finetune_integration.py). By default, the script assumes the scGPT checkpoint folder stored in the `examples/save` directory.

## To-do-list

- [x] Upload the pretrained model checkpoint
- [x] Publish to pypi
- [ ] Provide the pretraining code with generative attention masking
- [ ] Finetuning examples for multi-omics integration, cell type annotation, perturbation prediction, cell generation
- [x] Example code for Gene Regulatory Network analysis
- [x] Documentation website with readthedocs
- [x] Bump up to pytorch 2.0
- [x] New pretraining on larger datasets
- [x] Reference mapping example
- [ ] Publish to huggingface model hub
